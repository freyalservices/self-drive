Project 3: Self-Driving Car Simulation with Real-Time AI Traffic Control

Project Brief:
Developed a simulation of a self-driving car system integrated with real-time AI traffic management. The project focuses on navigation using computer vision and reinforcement learning while interacting with other AI-controlled entities in a virtual smart city environment. The simulation evaluates traffic flow, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic routing.
